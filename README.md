# Word Guess Game

## Description

A timed word guessing game.
The user has 30 seconds to guess the word. When a user correctly guesses a letter, the corresponding blank "_" is replaced by the letter. For example, if the user correctly selects "a", then "a _ _ a _" will appear. The user wins if they correctly guess the word before the time runs out. The user loses if the time runs out before they guess the word. Wins and loses are recorded to local storage.
